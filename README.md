## Tech Stack
![Catchoo_Tech_Stack](./cat-app-client/public/readMeImg/Catchoo_tech_stack.png)

- Front-end: React + Redux (State Management) + Redux-Saga (Async Actions Management)
- Back-end: SpringBoot + MariaDB

#### General
- Implemented RESTful Routes 
- **JWT** used to ensure scalability with a potential increase in the number of users.<br/>

#### Front-end
- **React** used to optimize rerendering and app performance.
- **React-Hooks** used to implement states and life cycle methods while using functional components for reusable and simple codes.
- **React-Router** used to manage routes and links.
- **Redux** used to centralize the states and logics of the app and to manage them easily.
- **Redux-Saga** used to manage asynchronous action flows.
- Other Tools
  * _immer_ to ensure immutability of states.
  * _Axios_ to handle HTTP requests based on promises.
  * _Redux-Persist_ to maintain states even after page reloads. Root state is purged after logout to ensure security.
  * _Styled-component_ to style components without triggering unnecessary rerenders, to store the shared design elements, and to provide dark/light mode options.
  * _React-Easy-Crop_ to crop uploaded images.
  * _React-Slick_ to create image carousels.
  * _Recharts_ to create charts.
  * _Font-Awesome_  to use various icons.

#### Back-End
- **Java** used to develop object based apps, which is easier as it helps keeps the system flexible and extensible.
- **Spring Framework** used to simplify enterprise-level Java development and loose coupling of code by dependency injection and AOP.
- **Spring Boot** used to make development, testing, and deployment more convenient.
- **Spring Security** used to implement authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks.
- **JPA(Hibernate)** used to manipulate data from database through an object-oriented program and improve productivity.
- **MariaDB** used to avoid data redundancy and data duplication.
- **Swagger UI** is implemented for better communication using APIs with Front-end team.
- Other Tools
  - *JUnit* used to write and run repeatable automated tests.
  - *Bean Validation* used to validate user input.
  - *Lombok* used to reduce boilerplate code for model/data objects. 
  - *Apache Commons Lang 3* used to manupulate core classes of Java APIs.

#### Deployment
- Front-end server deployed on Netlify (*temporary*) and AWS.
- Back-end server deployed on AWS <br/>
